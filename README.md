# Day-Planner

## Description

By using this website, the user will be able to make a day planner for themself by entering any input or event into any hour of their work day. The date at the top of the site and the hour in the day will automatically update to keep the user organized and up to date. The gray text boxes indicate that hour has passed, the coral text box indicates the present hour, and the green text indicates hours to come.

This website was refactored form it's original CSS and HTML files to have a more accurate and ineractive interface. In the future, I think it would be a great addition to have an alert at the top of the site expressing what input has been entered at the time it hits the appropriate hour.
